A Statistical Calculator, Powerful and simple to use. This project is being developed with Flet. For details about Flet, see: <https://flet.dev/docs/>
with the hope to be useful and help students in the learning process. I plan to include "solution steps" to make this easy and possible.

Feel free to use, modify it or contribute. I would be very pleased if you send me a Pull Request. 
I hope the code is readable and understandable for you, I'm sure you will enhance it.

**Run without Building or Installing**

It's possible to run directly from the source tree without building or installing. Simply run:

`flet run main.py`


This can be useful if you just want to quickly try out Datastair Calculator or test a change.
But note that this will run it without using Hot Reload. To solve this, simply run:
